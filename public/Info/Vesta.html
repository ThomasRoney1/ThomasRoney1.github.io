        <h2>About Vesta</h2>
        <p>
          Vesta is one of the largest asteroids in the asteroid belt, with a diameter of about 525 kilometers (326 miles). It is the second-most massive object in the asteroid belt, after Ceres, and was discovered by German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers in 1807. Vesta is unique because, unlike many asteroids, it has a differentiated interior, meaning it has a crust, mantle, and core, much like Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vesta's surface is highly diverse, with large craters, ridges, and mountains. The most notable feature of Vesta is its massive impact crater, known as Rheasilvia, which spans around 500 kilometers (310 miles) across. The formation of this crater released vast amounts of material, some of which have been found on Earth as meteorites, known as Vestoids. This suggests that Vesta is an important source of meteoritic material that has collided with our planet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vesta's surface is mostly made up of rock and minerals like basalt and other igneous rock, indicating past volcanic activity. Observations by NASA's Dawn spacecraft, which orbited Vesta between 2011 and 2012, revealed that the asteroid has been shaped by both impacts and internal geological processes. The spacecraft also detected the presence of water-bearing minerals, hinting at the possibility that Vesta once had the conditions necessary for liquid water.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vesta's history is still a subject of much research. While it has a rich and varied geological history, it has remained largely unchanged for billions of years, preserving a snapshot of the early solar system. The study of Vesta provides valuable insights into the processes that shaped the formation of terrestrial planets like Earth.
