        <h2>About Vega</h2>
        <p>
          Vega is the fifth-brightest star in the night sky and the second-brightest in the northern hemisphere, following only Arcturus. Located in the constellation Lyra, it is part of the famous Summer Triangle, along with Altair and Deneb. Vega is classified as an A-type main sequence star, and it is approximately 25 light-years away from Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vega is about twice as massive as our Sun and has around 40 times its luminosity. Its blue-white light makes it an iconic star, visible even from urban locations on clear nights. Vega is also notable for being one of the first stars to be photographed in color and for being the first star to have its spectrum analyzed in detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vega's history as a navigational aid is significant. It was once the North Star, thousands of years ago, due to the precession of Earth's axis. Over the next 12,000 years, Vega will again become the North Star as the Earthâ€™s axis shifts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The star is known for its rapid rotation, completing a full turn in just about 12.5 hours, which is much faster than the Sun's rotation period of around 25 days. This rapid spinning causes it to have a slightly oblate shape, making its equator bulge out a bit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vega is surrounded by a disk of debris, consisting of cosmic dust and possibly planetary bodies. The study of this disk has provided astronomers with insights into the processes that might occur around young stars and the potential for planet formation.
