        <h2>About Triton</h2>
        <p>
          Triton is the largest moon of Neptune and one of the few moons in the solar system that has a retrograde orbit, meaning it orbits Neptune in the opposite direction of the planet's rotation. This unusual orbit suggests that Triton may have been captured by Neptune's gravity rather than forming alongside the planet. Triton is a fascinating world with a number of unique characteristics, including its icy surface, geysers, and potential for cryovolcanism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Triton is covered by a layer of nitrogen ice, and its surface features vast plains of frozen nitrogen and methane. The moon also displays remarkable geysers that erupt plumes of nitrogen gas and dust, reaching as high as 8 kilometers (5 miles) into space. These geysers may be powered by internal heat, possibly from tidal forces resulting from Triton's retrograde orbit. The presence of these plumes suggests a dynamic and active environment beneath the icy crust.
        </p>
        <p>
          The moon has a very thin atmosphere, primarily composed of nitrogen with small amounts of methane. Despite its thinness, this atmosphere is enough to create clouds and a hazy orange appearance. The surface temperature of Triton is extremely cold, averaging around -235°C (-391°F), making it one of the coldest objects in the solar system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Triton was discovered in 1846 by British astronomer William Lassell, just days after Neptune was first observed. NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft conducted the most extensive exploration of Triton during its flyby in 1989, providing the first close-up images and data. These findings revealed the moon's icy surface and active geysers, sparking interest in the possibility of a subsurface ocean or other forms of internal activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Triton is a key object in the study of planetary moons and the evolution of icy bodies. Understanding its geological features and atmospheric processes offers valuable insights into the complex interactions between moons, their parent planets, and the environment of the outer solar system.
