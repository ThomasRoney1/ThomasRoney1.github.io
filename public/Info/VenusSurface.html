        <h2>About Venus Surface</h2>
        <p>
          Venus, often called Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and composition, has a surface that is both hostile and fascinating. With surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead, Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. The average temperature on Venus is around 465°C (869°F), which is even hotter than Mercury, despite being farther from the Sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          The surface of Venus is covered by vast plains of volcanic rock, towering mountains, and deep valleys. The planet's surface pressure is about 92 times that of Earth’s, which is equivalent to the pressure found 900 meters (3,000 feet) underwater on Earth. These extreme conditions are largely due to the thick atmosphere, composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat in a runaway greenhouse effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Venus's surface is also obscured by thick clouds, making it impossible to see the surface with visible light from Earth. However, radar mapping from spacecraft such as NASA's Magellan has revealed detailed images of the planet’s surface, uncovering features like large volcanic regions, impact craters, and vast highland areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most notable features of Venus is the existence of vast volcanic plains, which indicate that the planet may still be volcanically active. The surface is also scarred by extensive rift valleys, formed by tectonic processes. While Venus lacks large-scale plate tectonics like Earth, its surface is constantly reshaped by volcanic and tectonic activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exploration of Venus is incredibly challenging due to the extreme temperatures and pressures. However, missions such as NASA's Venera program and ESA's Akatsuki spacecraft continue to provide valuable data about the planet's surface and atmosphere, helping us to better understand the geology and climate of Venus, and providing insights into the evolutionary history of terrestrial planets.
