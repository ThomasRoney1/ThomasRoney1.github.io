        <h2>About the Great Red Spot</h2>
        <p>
          The Great Red Spot is a massive, persistent anticyclonic storm located in the southern hemisphere of Jupiter. This storm is so large that it could fit three Earths inside of it. It has been continuously observed for over 400 years, making it one of the most iconic features of Jupiter. Despite its name, the storm’s color can vary, sometimes appearing more orange or brown.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Great Red Spot is believed to have existed for at least 400 years, with the first documented sightings occurring in the 1600s. It was first described by astronomer Giovanni Cassini, and later, the storm's size and intensity were studied extensively by space missions such as NASA's Voyager, Galileo, and Juno spacecraft.
        </p>
        <p>
          This storm is thought to be driven by Jupiter’s intense atmospheric conditions, including its rapid rotation and the dynamics of its hydrogen and helium-rich atmosphere. Winds in the Great Red Spot can reach speeds of up to 432 km/h (268 mph), and the storm has been shrinking in recent decades, although it still remains a striking feature of Jupiter.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exact cause of the Great Red Spot’s reddish color remains a subject of scientific investigation. It is believed that chemicals such as phosphorus or sulfur compounds in Jupiter's atmosphere may react with ultraviolet light from the Sun, contributing to the storm’s distinctive hue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although it has been shrinking, the Great Red Spot continues to be a subject of great interest to astronomers, offering insights into the dynamics of Jupiter’s atmosphere and the mechanisms of long-lived storms in gas giants.
